An example:

[CodeUI](github.com/ryanraposo/codeui) is an extension for VS Code. It's a niche product, and it's powered by specific technology. Many contributors will have applicable skills, but some aspects may be confusing. 

Hopefully, adding a dynamic 'Resources' section will allow everyone to:
- Address learning-curves in the project.
- Spin-up quickly.

Along with a couple templates to Request/Propose topics, everyone should:
- Feel comfortable asking questions.
- Have enough insight to teach.

All developers stand to learn because they all stand to teach!

This doc/template combo might help the process along. :)
