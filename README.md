An example:

[CodeUI](github.com/ryanraposo/codeui) is an extension for VS Code. It's a niche product, and it's powered by specific technology. Many contributors will have applicable skills, but some aspects may be confusing. 

All developers stand to learn because we all have something to teach.

Hopefully, adding a 'Resources' section will allow everyone to:
- Address learning-curves the project.
- Spin-up quickly.

Along with a couple templates to Request/Propose topics, everyone should:
- Feel comfortable asking questions.
- Have enough insight to teach.

In other words: we can learn as a team. :)
